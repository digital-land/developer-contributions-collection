# Updating the collection

We recommend working in [virtual environment](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) before installing the python [requirements](requirements.txt), [makerules](https://github.com/digital-land/makerules) and other dependencies. Requires Make v4.0 or above.

    $ make makerules
    $ make init
    $ make collect

# Nightly collection

The collection is [updated nightly](https://github.com/digital-land/ZZZ/actions) by the [GitHub Action](.github/workflows/run.yml).

# Building the national dataset

The collected files can then be converted into a national dataset:

    $ make
